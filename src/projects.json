          "description": "During my time refining my object-oriented programming skills, I decided to follow along with a project course, in which I followed along in creating a copy of Spotify 2017, a music streaming service. I wanted to create a service that would allow users to create their own playlists and listen to their music.\n\n To create this project, I used PHP, MySQL, CSS, JavaScript and AJAX. I used PHP to create the backend of the website, which would handle the user authentication and the database queries. I used MySQL to store the data for the website, which would store the user information, the songs and the playlists. I used CSS to style the website, which would allow the website to look almost identical to that which I was replicating, with minor changes for personal styling choices. I used JavaScript to create the front-end of the website, which would allow the user to interact with the website. I used AJAX to create the asynchronous requests to the server, which would allow the website to be more responsive.",
